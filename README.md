# jrts-snipcart-components

## Overview

React components library designed to be used with [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/)

This package has two purposes.
1. I wanted to learn Typescript, SCSS, and how to publish a library to NPM using build tools like Webpack
2. I wanted to have components that I use for eCommerce sites in a library for re-use.

With that in mind, there is a high chance that some aspects of the project do not use best practices. If you notice anything, please let me know.

Furthermore, I cannot guarantee expedient documentation or help if you choose to use the package.

## Documentation

You can view how to use the components [here](https://jdretz.github.io/jrts-snipcart-components/index.html). The site uses [React Styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) to generate documentation of props and display the component in action.

The **BuyButton** component uses the React hook ```forwardRef```. Unfortunately, React Styleguide has trouble displaying it, for that reason, and does not give it the proper name. However, the props are still visible.
